# [X-Linked Recessive Diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-linked_recessive_inheritance)

### Most common

The most common X-linked recessive disorders are:

-   [Red–green color blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red–green_color_blindness), a very common trait in humans and frequently used to explain X-linked disorders. Between seven and ten percent of men and 0.49% to 1% of women are affected. Its commonness may be explained by its relatively benign nature. It is also known as daltonism.
-   [Hemophilia A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemophilia_A), a [blood clotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coagulation) disorder caused by a [mutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutation) of the [Factor VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_VIII) [gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gene) and leading to a deficiency of Factor VIII. It was once thought to be the "royal disease" found in the descendants of Queen Victoria. This is now known to have been Hemophilia B (see below).
-   [Hemophilia B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemophilia_B), also known as Christmas disease, a [blood clotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coagulation) disorder caused by a [mutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutation) of the [Factor IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_IX) [gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gene) and leading to a deficiency of Factor IX. It is rarer than [hemophilia A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hemophilia_A). As noted above, it was [common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemophilia_in_European_royalty) among the descendants of Queen Victoria.
-   [Duchenne muscular dystrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchenne_muscular_dystrophy), which is associated with mutations in the [dystrophin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dystrophin) gene. It is characterized by rapid progression of muscle degeneration, eventually leading to loss of skeletal muscle control, respiratory failure, and death.
-   [Becker's muscular dystrophy](Becker'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/s_muscular_dystrophy), a milder form of Duchenne, which causes slowly progressive muscle weakness of the legs and [pelvis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelvis).
-   [X-linked ichthyosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-linked_ichthyosis), a form of [ichthyosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ichthyosis) caused by a [hereditary deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genetic_disorder) of the [steroid sulfatase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steroid_sulfatase) (STS) enzyme. It is fairly rare, affecting one in 2,000 to one in 6,000 males.
-   [X-linked agammaglobulinemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-linked_agammaglobulinemia) (XLA), which affects the body's ability to fight infection. XLA patients do not generate mature [B cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_cell). B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called [immunoglobulins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immunoglobulin)) which defends the body from infections (the [humoral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humoral) response). Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections.
-   [Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency), which causes nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to a number of causes, most commonly infection or exposure to certain medications, chemicals, or foods. Commonly known as "favism", as it can be triggered by chemicals existing naturally in broad (or fava) beans.

### Less common disorders

Theoretically, a mutation in any of the [genes on chromosome X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Genes_on_human_chromosome_X) may cause disease, but below are some notable ones, with short description of symptoms:

-   [Adrenoleukodystrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenoleukodystrophy); leads to progressive brain damage, failure of the adrenal glands and eventually death.
-   [Alport syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alport_syndrome); glomerulonephritis, endstage kidney disease, and hearing loss. A minority of Alport syndrome cases are due to an autosomal recessive mutation in the gene coding for [type IV collagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_IV_collagen).
-   [Androgen insensitivity syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome); variable degrees of undervirilization and/or infertility in XY persons of either sex

-   [Centronuclear myopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centronuclear_myopathy); where cell nuclei are abnormally located in skeletal muscle cells. In CNM the nuclei are located at a position in the center of the cell, instead of their normal location at the periphery.
-   [Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMTX2-3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcot–Marie–Tooth_disease); disorder of nerves (neuropathy) that is characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation, predominantly in the feet and legs but also in the hands and arms in the advanced stages of disease.
