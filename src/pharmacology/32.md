## Histamine Physiology

**Where is Histamine found???**
* Mast cells (H1) - **Allergy**
* Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells of stomach (H2) - **Acid Secretion**
* Neurons (H1) - **Arousal**

**Mast Cells**

Cells are sensitized by IgE antibodies
attached to their surface, exposure to that antigen causes degranulation

**Non IgE mediated Allergy**

Some drugs (e.g., morphine) can displace
histamine from the storage complexes (“non-cytolytic release”)

## H1 Receptor Antagonists - 1st Generation

**Chlorpheniramine & Diphenhydramine & Promethazine & Meclizine & Hydroxyzine**

*MOA:* Reversible inhibitors of histamine-1 receptors

*Uses:*
* Allergic reaction
* URI
* Motion sickness
* Anti-emetic
* Sleep aid

*SE:*
* **Anticholinergic side effect**
  * Blurred vision (Mydriasis - pupil dilation)
  * Constipation
  * Decreased sweating
  * Dizziness
  * Dry mouth
* Difficulty urinating
* Sedation
* Synergistic sedation with other sedating medications
* Paradoxical Effect - In kids, may cause excitation!


## H1 Receptor Antagonists - 2nd Generation
**Loratadine & Cetirizine & Fexofenadine & Azelastine**

*Isomers* **Desloratadine & Levocetirizine**

*MOA:* Same as 1st Generation

*Use:* **Allergy Rhinitis Only**

*SE:*
* **Far less sedating than 1st generation** because of decreased entry into CNS
* **Less anticholinergic side effects**

## Other Antihistamines
### Histamine Release Inhibitors
**Cromolyn sodium (OTC)**

*MOA:* **Stabilizes mast cells** (Inhibits degranulation)

*Use:* prophylaxis of bronchial asthma & Allergic
Rhinitis. Ineffective after the acute asthma attack has begun

*Safe in Pregnancy*

**Nedocromil**
* *Topical ophthalmic agent*
* Seems to work similar to Cromolyn Sodium


**Olopatadine**

* *Topical ophthalmic agent*
* *MOA:* Beta2 agonists also appear to reduce histamine release.

**Montelukast** Suffix-Lukast

*MOA:* **Block Leukotriene receptors** thus blocking bronchoconstriction

*Use:*
* Aspirin induced and exercise induced Asthma
* Allergic rhinitis

*SE:* Nothing
