# Prostaglandins Summary
* PGE1: Decreases vascular tone, Increases uterine tone
* PGE2: Increases uterine tone, Gastric protection, renal vasodilation
* PGF2: Increases aqueous humor ï¬‚ow
* PGI: Decreases vascular tone
* TXA2 (Thromboxane): Stimulates platelet aggregation

## Prostaglandins I
### PGE1
**Alprostadil**

*Use:*
* Maintains patency of ductus arteriosus
* 2nd line for treatment of Erectile dysfunction

**PGE1 Analogue - Misoprostol**

*MOA:*
* Increases production of gastric mucosal barriers and decreases acid production
* Increases uterine tone

*Use:*
* Prevention of NSAID induced peptic ulcers
* Induction of labor by ripening of cervix

*SE:* Women of childbearing potential (Abortifacient)

### PGE2
**Dinoprostone**

*MOA:* Increases uterine tone

*Use:* Cervical ripening prior to induction of labor

## Prostaglandins II
### PGF2
**Latanoprost, Bimatoprost, Travoprost, Carboprost**

*MOA:* Decrease intraocular pressure by Increasing outflow of aqueous humor

*Use:* **Glaucoma**

*SE:*
* ***Eyelash Growth***
* **Darkens color of Iris**

### PGI2
**Epoprostenol**

*MOA:* Vasodilation of pulmonary arteries and decrease platelet aggregation

*Use:* **Pulmonary Hypertension**

## Leukotrienes
### LT Receptor Antagonist
**Montelukast & Zafirlukast** Suffix-Lukast

*MOA:* **Block Leukotriene receptors** thus blocking Bronchoconstriction

*Use:*
* Aspirin induced and exercise induced Asthma
* Allergic rhinitis

*SE:* Nothing

### 5-LOX inhibitor
**Zileuton**

*MOA:*
* Block Enzyme
* Lipo-oxygenase inhibitor blocking arachidonic acid conversion to leukotrienes

*Use:* Same as the leukotriene receptor antagonists

## COX 1 vs. COX 2

# NSAIDs
**Ibuprofen, Ketorolac, Naproxen, Diclofenac, Indomethacin**

*MOA:* Inhibit COX 1 and COX2 and block prostaglandin synthesis

*Use:*
* Fever
* Inflammatory conditions (RA, OA, Gout)
* Indomethacin is used to close Patent Ductus Arteriosus (Patency depends on PGE)

*SE:*
* Gl bleed
* Interstitial Nephritis
* Renal Ischemia
* Prostaglandins vasodilate afferent arterioles- NSAIDs vasoconstrict

## Aspirin
*MOA:*
* **Irreversibly inhibit COX 1 and COX2** by covalent acetylation decreasing prostaglandins
* Decrease synthesis of TXA2 (platelet aggregation)

*Use:*
* Low dose (<300mg)= Antiplatelet used in Ml and CVA
* Medium dose (300-2400mg)= antipyretic and analgesic
* High dose (2400-4000mg)= Anti-Inflammatory

*SE:*

* Bleeding due to platelet inhibition- lasts 7 days
* Gl Bleeding (PGE inhibition)
* **Tinnitus (CN 8)**
* ***Reye Syndrome in children with viral infections (Hepatic Encephalopathy)***

*Overdose:*
* Early- **Respiratory alkalosis** (ASA stimulates respiratory center)
* Late- Anion gap metabolic acidosis

*Treatment of overdose:* Urinary alkalinization (Because ASA is a weak acid)

## COX 2 Inhibitors
**Celecoxib**

*MOA:*
* Selectively inhibit COX 2 inhibiting PGE2 and PGI2 responsible for pain and inflammation
* Spares COX 1 and PGE2 responsible for maintaining gastric mucosal

*Use:* Osteoarthritis in patients with previous or high risk of Gl bleed

*SE:*
* Increased risk of thrombosis
  * TXA2 is spared since it depends on COX1
* Increased risk of MI

## Acetaminophen (APAP)
*MOA:*
* Poorly understood
* Reversibly inhibits COX

*Use:*
* Fever (Use instead of ASA in children)
* Chronic pain (No Gl or renal SE)
* NOT anti-inflammatory

*SE:*
* **Overdose leads to liver failure**
* Hepatic necrosis (Centrilobular necrosis)
* Risk increases with alcohol consumption (CYP induction and glutathione depletion)

*Mechanism of APAP overdose:*
* Metabolized by CYP 450 in liver
* **Metabolite (NAPQI) depletes Glutathione**
* NAPQI leads to reactive oxygen radical leading to injury

*Antidote:* **N-Acetylcysteine**: Regenerates glutathione
