# Calcium Homeostasis Drugs
## Bisphosphonates
*Oral Agents* **Alendronate & Risedronate**

*IV Agents* **Zoledronic acid & Ibandronate**

*MOA:* **Inhibits osteoclasts -> inhibiting bone resorption**

**Pyrophosphate analog**
* Bind hydroxyapatite and incorporated into bone. Taken up by osteoclasts.

*Administration:*
* Must be take **with water on an empty stomach**
* As soon as you wake up or **2 hours prior to breakfast**
* ***Must remain upright for at least 30 minutes after administration***

*Uses:*
* **Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal women (1st line)**
* Prevention of Osteoporosis
* Paget's disease
* Hypercalcemia associated with malignancy

*SE:*
* Local irritation of the upper Gl mucosa.
* **Esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and erosions**
* Upset stomach and heartburn, gastritis.
* **Osteonecrosis of the jaw, Atypical femoral fractures**
* Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia

## Anti-RANKL Monoclonal Antibody
**Denosumab**
*MOA:*
* Binds RANKL
  * Inhibits proliferation, differentiation, and maturation of pre-osteoclasts
  * Decreases remodeling, and increases bone mineral density

*Use:* Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women

*Admin:* SubQ injection Q6 months

*SE:* **Hypocalcemia, infections, skin reactions, ONJ**

*Contraindications:* **Hypocalcemia**

## Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)
*Secretion:*
* Stimulated by low Extracellular CA2+
* GPCR CA2+ Sensor

*Actions:*
* Bone -> Induces osteoclast differentiation factor. **Increased OsteoCLAST activity.**
* Renal ->Increase **reabsorption of Ca2+ and Mg2+ & Increases creation of 1,25 - Vitamin D**

**Final outcome: Increase Ca2+ into extracellular compartment!**

*Uses:*
1. **Hypocalcemia**
2. Adjunct for hypoparathyroidism not well controlled with Ca+2 & Vitamin D supplementation
3. **Challenge for Pseudohypoparathyroidism**

### Human Recombinant Parathyroid Hormone (hrPTH) & Teriparatide Acetate

*MOA:*
* Daily intermittent administration
* Increases number and activity of Osteoblasts

*Uses:* Osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women who are at high risk for fracture

**Does not produce bone resorption.** Increases the
formation of new bone and will decrease the fracture risk.

**Black Box Warning:**
* Risk Osteosarcoma
* Malignancies & Paget's disease & Metabolic bone disease
  * **Use for max of 2 years**

*SE:*
* Nausea, dizziness
* Headache
* Leg cramps
* Orthostasis
* Hypercalcemia

## Calcitriol
*MOA:*
* Steroid, intracellular nuclear hormone receplor
* 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (Active Form)

*Actions:*

* Increases intestinal Ca2+ Absorption
* Stimulates Osteocalcin (bone matrix protein)
* Enhances CA+2 mobilization from bone

*Uses:*
* Hypoparathyroidism
* Pseudohypoparathyroidism
* Osteoporosis
* Rickets and Osteomalacia
* Hypocalcemia and CKD

*SE:*
* **Hypervitaminosis D**
  * **Hypercalcemia-**
  * Withdrawal offending agent!
  * Fluids, low calcium diet, and glucocorticoids

## Calcitonin
*MOA:*
* GPCR -> AC-> cAMP
* Peptide Hormone

*Action:*
* Inhibits Osteoclast-mediated Ca+2 mobilization.
* Increase Renal Ca+2 excretion and Increases PO4- excretion.
*  Thought to only be physiologically significant under stress conditions.

*Clinical Uses:*
* Severe Hypercalcemia
* Osteoporosis
* Paget's disease.

***Osteoporosis in those who cannot take Bisphosphonates***

*SE:*
* Nausea
* Facial flushing, runny nose
* Swelling of hands
* Injection site inflammation
* Urticaria

*Prolonged use down-regulates receplors*

# Osteoporosis
## Postmenopausal Women and Men
*Firstline* - Oral Bisphosphonate: **Alendronate & Risedronate**

*Severe Disease* (Patient with Dexa Scan T-score < 3.5): **Teriparatide Acetate**

## Premenopausal Women
**Women with amenorrhea -> Treat underlying cause**

* Bisphosphonate
  * “long-term efficacy and safety data are scarce in premenopausal women”
* **Teriparatide**
* **SERMs (Raloxifene and tamoxifen)**
  * should not be used to treat osteoporosis in menstruating women as
they block estrogen action on bone, leading to further bone loss

# Hypercalcemia & Hyperkalemia
### Hypercalcemia
* **Normal Saline**
  * Corrects dehydration
* **IV Furosemide**
  * Increase Ca excretion
* **IM/SC Calcitonin**
  * For 2 days only- receptor downregulation
* **IV bisphosphonate**
* Treat underlying cause

### Hyperkalemia
**Short term**
* IV Insulin Plus Dextrose
  * (Pushes K inside cells using Na-K ATPase)
* Sodium Bicarbonate IV
  * (Correct acidosis and exchanges extracellular K for intracellular H)
* Albuterol Inhaled (Adrenergic agonist)
  * Stimulate Na-K ATPase
*  Calcium IV
  * Stabilize cardiac membrane and prevent arrhythmia if there's ECG changes

**Intermediate term**
* **Sodium polystyrene - Oral**
  * Binds K in colon and increase secretion
* Furosemide IV
  * Increase renal excretion of K

**Long term**
* Dialysis
* Fix underlying cause
