## RA Big Picture
Problem: TNF inflammation and Rheumatoid factor made by B cells

How to fix it?
* Symptom management
  * Decrease non-specific inflammation acutely
    * **NSAIDs** and **Glucocorticoids**
* Modify the disease progression
  * Prevent synthesis of DNA needed for leukocytes: **MTX**. **Leflunomide**, **Azathioprine**
  * Decrease/modulate lymphocyte action: **Hydroxychloroquine**, **Sulfasalazine**
  * Block TNF: **Etanercept**, **Infliximab**, **Adalimumab**
  * Block B Cells: **Rituximab**
  * Block T cell stimulation: **Abatacept**
  * Block Interleukins
    * IL 1: **Anakinra**, **Canakinumab**
    * IL 6: **Tocilizumab**

## Rheumatoid Arthritis
**General**

The goal of RA treatment is low disease activity or ideally, remission
Treat with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and Anti-inflammatories

* Non Biologic DMARDs - Methotrexate, Leflunomide, Sulfasalazine, elc.
* Biologic DMARDs - etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab
* Anti Inflammatories - Corticosteroids and NSAIDs

DMARDSs should be started within three months of diagnosis for most patients.

Treatment decisions are based on the patient's disease
activity, disease duration, prognosis, and current RA regimen.

**Acute Flair: NSAID with Corticosteroid**

**Chronic Treatment Progression**

1. **Nonbiologic DMARDs**
Monotherapy recommended in early disease with low
disease activity, and in early disease of moderate
activity without poor prognosis.
2. **Nonbiologic DMARDSs in Combination**
More effective than monotherapy. Combinations
typically consist of methotrexate (the “anchor” drug)
plus one or two other DMARDs
3. **Biologic DMARDS**
After nonbiologic DMARD failure in a patient with
poor prognosis (e.g., highly active disease, early
joint damage, rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated
protein antibody), or after inadequate response o
two nonbiologic DMARD regimens in a patient without
poor Prognosis.
