# Antipsychotic Agents - Typicals
## General Characteristics
*MOA:* Block D2 receptors in Basal Ganglia, Frontal lobe, Limbic system

*Use:* 2nd line for Schizophrenia after atypicals D2 SE & Anticholinergic SE related to Potency

*SE:*
* **D2 blockade**
  * Motor side effects ([EPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptoms), TD)
  * Prolactinemia (Pituitary)
  * NMS
* Anticholinergic: Dry mouth, constipation, Urinary retention , mydriasis
* Alpha blockade: Orthostasis & Impotence
* Histamine blockade: Sedation
* DAJSHT: Anti-Emetic (Gut)
* Prolong QT

## Typical Antipsychotics
**Chlorpromazine** (Low Potency)
* MOA: Blocks D2, **alpha 1**, **Histamine**, Muscarinic
* More Anticholinergic Symptoms

**Haloperidol** (High Potency)
* Mostly blocks D2
* More [EPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrapyramidal_symptoms) symptoms

## EPS & Anticholinergic SE
#### What are Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)?
* Cause: Decreased DA in Basal Ganglia
* Hours to days
  * **Dystonia** (continuous spasms and muscle contractions)
* Days to months
  * **Akathisia (motor restlessness)**
  * Bradykinesia (slowness of movement)
* Months to years
  * **Tardive dyskinesia (Orofacial Chorea)**
  * **Most feared complication-Not reversible**
* Treatment
  * Benztropine (Anticholinergic) for acute dystonia and Tardive dyskinesia
    * Ach is inhibitory in basal ganglia
  * Benzodiazepines and Beta blockers for akathisia

#### What are Anti-Cholinergic side effects? (TODO)

# Antipsychotic Agents - Atypicals
## General Characteristics
*MOA:* Antagonizes specific D2/D4 and 5-HT binding

*Use:* 1st line for Schizophrenia

*SE:*
* **Metabolic syndrome = Weight gain, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia**
* Less Anticholinergic SE
* Less EPS SE

## Atypical Antipsychotics
#### Aripiprazole
MOA: Partial agonist in the class (D2, 5HT1) - 3rd generation
#### Clozapine
* MOA: D2, D4, 5HT antagonist (**Most Effective AP**)
* Effective for negative sx
* **Serious SE: Agranulocytosis**
  * Needs frequent CBC
  * Lowers Seizure threshold
#### Olanzapine
* Effective for negative sx
* SE: Weight gain, metabolic syndrome (Worst)
#### Risperidone
* D2 antagonist
* SE: EPS, Prolactinemia
#### Ziprasidone

# NMS vs. Serotonin Syndrome
### Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
Too little Dopamine
  * Hyperadrenergic response

Time: Within days to weeks

**Cause: Antipsychotics that block Dopamine**

**Symptoms**
* Muscle Rigidity
* Elevated muscle enzymes (Myoglobin and CPK)
* HTN and tachycardia
* Fever

**Tx**
* Muscle relaxants (Dantrolene)
* **D2 agonists (Bromocriptine)**

### Serotonin Syndrome
Too much Serotonin

Time: Within 24 hours

Cause: **Antidepressants that increase serotonin** (MAO-I, SSRI, SNRI, TCA, Tramadol, Ondansetron, Triptans, Linezolid, MDMA, Dextromethorphan)

**Symptoms**
* Hyperreflexia
* Diaphoresis, Diarrhea
* Agitation

**Tx**: **Serotonin antagonist (Cyproheptadine)**

# Disease Summary
**Schizophrenia**
* **Positive Symptoms**
  * 1st line: Atypicals
  * 2nd line: Typicals
  * 3rd line: Clozapine
* **Negative Symptoms**: Clozapine, Olanzapine
